# Team 3882 Robot Code

Team 3882 Robot Code for FIRST Robotics Competition 2017 STEAMWORKS
Welcome to the Team 3882 2017 Steamworks 2017-Robot Iterative File!(Brought to you by the Programming Branch of Team 3882)
You may have noticed that most published FRC coding projects are utiilizing the command based structure, in order to run their robots in a simple, modular, sleek, and easy to understand. You also may have noticed, that Team 3882, does not. We utiliaed the Iterative style project. It allowed us to do some interesting and more complex code. Hopefully, this guide can help you fully comprehend the irrevicable nuances of coding in Iterative. Let's get started!

Imports:
The imports in all coding is extremely important, because this is where we draw our constructors from. Without imports, your robot can't do anything! It is important to noticed that in addition to the Wpilibj library, Firsts outsources some of
